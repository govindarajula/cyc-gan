These are a few links which are tangential to the core topic, but interesting to explore and study as an extension to the baseline model / improvements done so far.

* taesung.me/cyclegan/2017/03/25/maps-comparison.html 

* BicycleGAN: cVAE-GAN + cLR-GAN

* github.com/yunjey/mnist-svhn-transfer  (a scaled down and simple implementation, cosnuming less GPU power)

* github.com/PramuPerera/In2I (recent code - better scores at unpaired img-to-img translation than cycle-gan)

* web.stanford.edu/~jaustinb/papers/CS236.pdf (sim2real)

* downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2019/4932782.pdf (data hiding)

* arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02950.pdf (stenography)

Beyond the scope of the project submitted, an extension upon these domains can be done.

> For our models and training, an update with resized convoltions and comparative analytics has been the primary objective. This is briefly detailed in the two presentation files in regards to approach and outputs.
